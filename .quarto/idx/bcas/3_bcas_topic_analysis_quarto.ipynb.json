The total number of topics has steadily increased over the years, peaking in 2019-2023. The Applied Sciences domain shows the most variety, which reflects China's strategic emphasis on S&T and its focus on applied research.\n\nIn contrast, the dynamics of topics within the Economic & Social Sciences domain remain stable.\n\nMeanwhile, the presence of Arts & Humanities has dwindled to near non-existence. Previously, these topics were reflected in articles covering CAS historical matters and biographies of prominent scientists. The shift towards more application-oriented publications suggests a broader move away from these areas.\n\n# Interdesciplinarity: Category Overlap\n\nSince we’ve tagged each article with multiple topics, some overlap is inevitable. By counting how often different topics show up together in the same articles, we can spot where they intersect. This will help us see how closely related different topics are and understand the connections between them better.\n\nThe 235 overlaps between topics like China’s S&T strategy and talent cultivation suggest a strong connection. Basically, discussions on innovation and strategic goals often go hand-in-hand with talks about nurturing scientific talent.\n\nAn overlap of 143 shows that open science and key labs are often discussed alongside policy research. So, when people talk about open science, it frequently ties into policy and innovation in national labs.\n\nFor the Belt and Road Initiative, we see an overlap of 74, which means that conversations about this initiative often include both S&T cooperation and sustainability. It's clear that the initiative's scientific side is linked with both collaborative efforts and long-term goals.\n\nThe 65 overlaps in sustainable development and big data point to a close relationship between these topics. It seems that discussions on sustainability often involve data-driven strategies.\n\nWhen it comes to Optical and Spectroscopic Detection Instruments and High-Power Solid-State Lasers, they overlap 49 times. This suggests a strong focus on advanced imaging and detection tech in these areas.\n\nThe overlap of 43 between renewable energy and carbon neutrality shows that these topics are closely connected. It highlights how renewable energy is key to reaching carbon neutrality goals.\n\nFinally, the 34 overlaps between biodiversity conservation and the CAS Field Observation Station Network suggest that these discussions are tied to monitoring and restoring ecosystems.\n\nOverall, these overlaps make sense. Many of these topics are closely related, which is why we see a lot of connections between them.\n\nWe may find more interesting inside moving up to the subfield level.\n\nFor example, we can see a tstrong connection between Strategic Studeis and Education subfields. \n\nEnvironmental Sciences show notable overlaps with several key subfields:\n\n- **Ecology**: Highlighting a strong connection between environmental sciences and ecological research.\n- **Environmental Engineering**: Emphasizing a significant link between these two areas.\n- **Energy**: Indicating that energy studies are closely tied to environmental science.\n- **Agronomy & Agriculture**: Showing the importance of environmental sciences in agricultural research.\n- **Information Systems**: Reflecting the intersection of environmental science with information technology.\n- **Science Studies**: Demonstrating how environmental sciences are integrated into broader scientific research.\n- **Education**: Suggesting that environmental science research contributes to educational topics.\n- **Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences**: Revealing a relationship between environmental sciences and atmospheric research.\n\nThese overlaps underscore the interdisciplinary nature of environmental sciences and their relevance across various fields.\n\nAt the field level, we see some interesting patterns. The most notable overlap is between **Enabling & Strategic Technologies** and **Social Sciences**, indicating a strong connection between technological advancements and social impacts. \n\n**Earth & Environmental Sciences** also show significant overlap with **Enabling & Strategic Technologies**, reflecting how environmental concerns are closely tied to technological developments. Additionally, there's a considerable intersection with **Information & Communication Technologies**, **Engineering**, and **Social Sciences**, underscoring the broad relevance of environmental science across different sectors.\n\nWhile there is a connection between **Earth & Environmental Sciences** and **Agriculture**, it’s not as pronounced, but it still points to an interplay between environmental and agricultural research.\n\nAt the domain level, Applied Sciences shows the strongest connections, with significant overlaps with Natural Sciences and Economic & Social Sciences. The largest overlap is with Natural Sciences (687), indicating a close relationship between these domains. There is also a substantial connection with Economic & Social Sciences (631), reflecting how applied research intersects with economic and social aspects.\n\nApplied Sciences also overlaps with Health Sciences (168) and Arts & Humanities (92), though these connections are less pronounced.\n\nAmong the other domains, Economic & Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities show a notable overlap (171), while Economic & Social Sciences and Health Sciences have a smaller, yet significant, overlap (62). Connections between Health Sciences and Arts & Humanities are minimal (7), and overlaps between Natural Sciences and Arts & Humanities are also limited (36).\n\n# Article Distributions\n\nAnother question is about article distributions: what are the areas of focus in expert research and analysis? While a diverse range of topics within a domain suggests breadth, it doesn't necessarily indicate depth--or that these topics are the most frequently discussed. Examining the volume of articles across different topics will reveal which subjects experts are most engaged with, providing a clearer picture of research priorities and trends.\n\nAnalysis of article distribution across domains reveals a clear dominance of Applied Sciences, particularly since 2020, when its share reached 54%. Concurrently, Social Sciences experienced a significant decline, with its share shrinking from 33.6% in 2009 to 18.2% in the most recent year. Arts & Humanities maintained a substantial presence before 2005 but has since shown a downward trend. In contrast, Health Sciences has seen an increase in its share over the past three years.\n\nAnalysis of field dynamics from 2013 to 2023 reveals a significant shift in the journal's focus. \n\nWhile Earth & Environmental Sciences remains a predominant field, Enabling & Strategic Technologies has emerged as the dominant area, claiming a 33.53% share in 2023. \n\nThe years 2020-2021 saw a notable increase in publications related to Clinical Medicine and Public Health & Health Services, likely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic—a trend corroborated by our exploratory data analysis of keyword frequencies.\n\nEngineering consistently represents a key research vector, maintaining a share between 11-13% from 2019 to 2023 (with the exception of 2022). Social Sciences, after peaking at 20-22% in 2015-2016, experienced a substantial decline, settling at 15.55% in recent years.\n\nInformation & Communication Technologies publications surged in 2021-2022, coinciding with two major events: the U.S. chip export ban on China and the emergence of advanced AI like ChatGPT. This period also saw a decline in science management topics. The shift suggests a pivot from theoretical discussions to practical applications, with researchers focusing more on developing technologies than debating how science should be organized.\n\nDuring Xi Jinping's era, the research articles predominantly centered around subfields like Environmental Sciences, Agronomy & Agriculture, Computer Hardware & Architecture, Ecology, Economics, Education, Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Energy, Environmental Engineering, Information Systems, Optoelectronics & Photonics, Science Studies, and Strategic, Defence & Security Studies.\n\nIn 2023, Optoelectronics & Photonics emerged as the most represented subfield, making up 14.29% of the topics. It was followed by Environmental Sciences at 12.22%, Strategic, Defence & Security Studies at 7.45%, Science Studies at 5.80%, and International Relations at 4.97%. While these numbers suggest a strong focus on these areas, there's an inconsistency: despite the apparent emphasis on Optoelectronics & Photonics, Strategic Studies, and Environmental Sciences, other important and emerging fields like Materials, Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences, Nuclear & Particle Physics, Microscopy, and Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging are underrepresented. \n\nThis underrepresentation could indicate a gap between the evolving scientific priorities and the actual research output, pointing to potential areas for future growth and exploration.\n\n# Topic Engagement: Views & Downloads\n\nBy analyzing Views and Downloads statistics for the past decade, we can gain insights into what topics truly attract the attention of the Chinese scientific community and officials, revealing the priorities and interests of both researchers and decision-makers.\n\nWe can start with calculating correlation between total views and downloads for each topic. Unsurprisingly, we get a correlation of 0.99, which basically means that the more a paper is viewed, the more it's downloaded—who would've thought?\n\nNext, we can analyze the relationship between views and the number of articles for each topic. This analysis will allow us to identify research areas that are over-performing—where views are disproportionately high compared to the number of articles published—and those that are under-performing, where the volume of publications does not correspond to a similarly high level of interest. This approach provides valuable insights into which topics are getting significant attention from the scientific community and which may not be as impactful despite a higher output of publications.\n\nAnalysis of article count versus view numbers reveals a positive correlation of 0.75, indicating that generally, more articles lead to more views. However, significant outliers exist, highlighting disparities in topic popularity:\n\nUnderperforming topics (low views despite high article count):\n\n1. CAS Divisions and Academicians: History and Development - 207 articles, 15,866 views\n2. CAS Academicians and Academic Divisions Work - 172 articles, 12,239 views\n3. Development History and Scientific Achievements of CAS - 340 articles, 95,401 views\n\nThese topics, primarily focused on institutional history and structure, attract fewer views relative to their article count, suggesting lower reader interest in internal organizational matters.\n\nOverperforming topics (high views despite low article count):\n1. Ecological Civilization Construction - 81 articles, 248,882 views\n2. Belt and Road Initiative:\n   - S&T Cooperation - 105 articles, 228,602 views\n   - S&T Innovation and Sustainable Development - 140 articles, 297,314 views\n\nThese topics, centered on current global initiatives and environmental concerns, garner more attention per article, indicating high reader engagement with contemporary, outward-facing issues.\n\nThis disparity in viewership suggests that while institutional topics are frequently published, reader interest leans towards current global and environmental themes.\n\nTo assess topic performance more effectively, we introduce a \"view efficiency\" metric, calculated by dividing a topic's view share by its article share. This ratio reveals which topics generate disproportionate interest relative to their publication volume. Topics with an efficiency score above 1 indicate higher-than-average reader engagement, while those below 1 suggest lower interest compared to their prevalence. \n\nThe following list presents the top 10 topics ranked by view efficiency:\n\nAnd 10 least efficient topics:\n\n# Organizations\n\nNext we can identify how different research areas are represented by organizations.\n\nThe highest variety of organizations is found in Applied Sciences, with 441 organizations. This is followed by Natural Sciences, which has 378 organizations. Economics and Social topics are represented by 247 organizations, while Health Sciences has 131 organizations, which is 100 fewer. The mos insignificant number of organizations (7) is in Arts and Humanities. \n\nThe frequency count of organizations indicates that the University of CAS leads across all domains, with general CAS affiliations also being common.\n\nThe Institutes of Science and Development ranks as the second top contributor in Economic and Social Sciences, third in Applied Sciences, and fifth in Natural Sciences.\n\nAdditionally, the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research is active in Applied, Natural, and Economic and Social Sciences.\n\nWhen categorizing organizations by fields, we find that the largest number is in Earth and Environmental Sciences, followed by Social Sciences. The next largest domain is Enabling and Strategic Technologies.\n\nInformation and Communication Technologies ranks next, followed by Engineering, Biology, and Agriculture.\n\nThe most represented subfields are:\n\n- Environmental Sciences\n- Ecology\n- Information Systems\n- Agronomy and Agriculture\n- Strategic, Defence, and Security Studies\n- Environmental Engineering\n- International Relations\n\n# Collaboration Network\n\nAn analysis of collaboration statistics across fields reveals distinct patterns:\n\n- Earth & Environmental Sciences boasts the largest network, but with low density (2.29%), indicating many small clusters. The University of CAS is central, followed by institutes focused on eco-environment, geography, and atmospheric physics.\n- Social Sciences, with 211 organizations, also centers around the University of CAS. The Institutes of Science and Development and the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth play key roles, reflecting the field's strategic focus.\n- Enabling & Strategic Technologies encompasses 187 organizations, with the University of CAS and Institutes of Science and Development as main hubs. Most organizations have fewer than 10 connections, resulting in low network density (2.28%).\n- Engineering, despite fewer organizations (121), has a denser network (5%), suggesting higher topic complexity and more interconnected collaborations.\n\n# Authors\n\nAnalysis of author counts by field shows significant growth across all domains except Humanities since 2016, with numbers peaking in 2023.\n\nApplied Sciences consistently dominates, accounting for about 40% of authors.\nEconomic & Social Sciences shows fluctuation, declining through the 2010s but rebounding in 2022-2023 to 26.5%.\nHealth Sciences maintains a smaller author share, but saw a sharp increase from 1.9% to 14.9% between 2019 and 2020, likely due to pandemic-related research.\nWe can also observe the death of Humanities, which experienced a significant decline, effectively disappearing by 2010.\n\nAt the field level, we see a distribution of expertise across various domains. Earth & Environmental Sciences topped the list, followed closely by Social Sciences and Enabling & Strategic Technologies. Engineering also drew a significant number of experts. A notable trend emerged in 2022, with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) experiencing a remarkable surge, jumping from 3.87% to 13.78%. This spike correlates with the rise of generative AI and the release of ChatGPT. Engineering followed suit with a similar boost in 2023, rising from 2.08% in 2022 to 11.96%. Additionally, Public Health & Health Services saw a significant uptick in 2020, highlighting its growing importance.\n\nHere we can observe the distributions by fields:\n\n# Fund Projects\n\nThe distribution of funded projects by field reveals a clear favorite: Applied and Natural Sciences, which isn’t too surprising.\n\nBetween 2013-2023 the largest amount of funding was associated with Earth & Environmental Sciences, followed by Enabling & Strategic Technologies and Social Sciences.\n\nA year-by-year count shows a noticeable increse in ICT funding in 2022, along with a peak in Social Sciences during the same year. Additionally, it's clear that Earth & Environmental Sciences, Enabling & Strategic Technologies, and Agriculture consistently receive more funding compared to other fields.\n\n# Summary\n\nTopic modeling has revealed key themes in BCAS publications, offering valuable insights into the evolving landscape of Chinese scientific research. Over time, the journal's content has diversified, with a noticeable shift towards practical applied research and natural sciences. While social and economic research maintains a significant presence, historical and biographical genres have largely faded from prominence.\n\nThe analysis unveils a clear connection between BCAS publications and the broader political and economic environment. For instance, the surge in Public Health publications in 2020 and the increased focus on ICT-related topics following the China Chip Export Ban and ChatGPT's release demonstrate the journal's responsiveness to current events. This alignment suggests that BCAS serves as a platform for China's academia to address pressing national issues.\n\nThe social economics discourse within BCAS predominantly centers on strategic issues and cutting-edge technologies. The overlap in topics indicates a strong interplay between strategy, enabling technologies, engineering, and education. These themes mirror the core elements of Chinese tech discourse: human capital development, leadership in emerging technologies, and industrial policy modernization. \n\nFurther evidence of this connection is found in the prominence of Earth & Environmental Sciences research. The consistent high volume of publications in this field throughout the years aligns with Xi Jinping's emphasis on green development and carbon neutrality goals. Notably, Environmental Sciences topics attract the highest number of contributing organizations, with some institutions extending their reach into other fields, highlighting a trend towards interdisciplinary research.\n\nTopics in these categories are more frequently associated with funded research, underscoring their strategic importance. Our analysis also identified the most significant contributing organizations between 2013-2023:\n\n- University of CAS\n- Institutes of Science and Development\n- Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research\n- Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources\n- Peking University\n\nHowever, it's crucial to recognize that while this bird's-eye view is informative, it has its limitations. For a deeper, more nuanced understanding of these topics and the specific research being conducted, there is no substitute for reading the articles themselves. This analysis proves that these materials are indeed valuable and worth reading for anyone seeking to gain a comprehensive understanding of CAS opinions and research vectors. \n\nThe trends and patterns identified here can guide researchers and policymakers towards the most relevant and impactful articles, organizations and experts, helping to navigate the vast landscape of Chinese scientific literature more effectively. \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nWe’ve enriched the data with a semantic layer, enabling us to delve into the evolving content of BCAS publications over the years.\n\nWith this enhancement, we can now:\n\n- Track shifts in the prevalence of specific topics.\n- Gauge interdisciplinarity across articles.\n- Analyze the distribution of topics.\n- Explore how reader engagement varies by views and downloads.\n- Uncover trends in what authors focus on over time.\n- Investigate organizational collaboration across different fields.\n- Assess the impact of funded projects.\n\nThis opens up a comprehensive view of how research priorities and collaborations have transformed within BCAS.\n\n# Research Variety: Topic Numbers over Time\n\nWe observe that Applied Sciences have consistently led in the number of topics throughout the entire period, with Natural Sciences following closely behind. The total number of topics has steadily increased over the years, peaking in 2019-2023. The Applied Sciences domain shows the most variety, which reflects China's strategic emphasis on S&T and its focus on applied research.\n\nIn contrast, the dynamics of topics within the Economic & Social Sciences domain remain stable.\n\nMeanwhile, the presence of Arts & Humanities has dwindled to near non-existence.

While social and economic research maintains a significant presence, historical and biographical genres have largely faded from prominence.\n\nThe analysis unveils a clear connection between BCAS publications and the broader political and economic environment. For instance, the surge in Public Health publications in 2020 and the increased focus on ICT-related topics following the China Chip Export Ban and ChatGPT's release demonstrate the journal's responsiveness to current events. This alignment suggests that BCAS serves as a platform for China's academia to address pressing national issues.\n\nThe social economics discourse within BCAS predominantly centers on strategic issues and cutting-edge technologies. The overlap in topics indicates a strong interplay between strategy, enabling technologies, engineering, and education. These themes mirror the core elements of Chinese tech discourse: human capital development, leadership in emerging technologies, and industrial policy modernization. \n\nFurther evidence of this connection is found in the prominence of Earth & Environmental Sciences research. The consistent high volume of publications in this field throughout the years aligns with Xi Jinping's emphasis on green development and carbon neutrality goals. Notably, Environmental Sciences topics attract the highest number of contributing organizations, with some institutions extending their reach into other fields, highlighting a trend towards interdisciplinary research.\n\nTopics in these categories are more frequently associated with funded research, underscoring their strategic importance. Our analysis also identified the most significant contributing organizations between 2013-2023:\n\n- University of CAS\n- Institutes of Science and Development\n- Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research\n- Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources\n- Peking University\n\nHowever, it's crucial to recognize that while this bird's-eye view is informative, it has its limitations. For a deeper, more nuanced understanding of these topics and the specific research being conducted, there is no substitute for reading the articles themselves. This analysis proves that these materials are indeed valuable and worth reading for anyone seeking to gain a comprehensive understanding of CAS opinions and research vectors. \n\nThe trends and patterns identified here can guide researchers and policymakers towards the most relevant and impactful articles, organizations and experts, helping to navigate the vast landscape of Chinese scientific literature more effectively.
